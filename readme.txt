This is a compilation of all project Euler solutions I have written. I like to jump around a bit to see what I can do. 

I'll write notes into this readme for all Project Euler Solutions to explain the solutions I originally came up with, and what I did to optimize them. Usually I come up with a working solution in about 10 minutes, however, that solution is almost never optimized properly. My fastest Solution so far has been Number 20, largely due to python's built in functions, which was 7 min after I solved 16.

I will add these explanations in the order I come up with them.
