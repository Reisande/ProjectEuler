This is a compilation of all project Euler solutions I have written. I like to jump around a bit to see what I can do. 

I'll write notes into this readme for all Project Euler Solutions to explain the solutions I originally came up with, and what I did to optimize them. Usually I come up with a working solution in about 10 minutes, however, that solution is almost never optimized properly.

I will add these explanations in the order I come up with them.
